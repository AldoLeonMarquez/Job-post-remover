Tired of seeing the same 3 jobs posted for 30 locations?? (Mic......) 

This script removes all the job postings from the companies you choose

Just a script rn, maybe I'll make it into an extension. But not looking forward to the arms race with MS :/

Use the Scripty extension to inject the script on load. 

Scroll to make them disappear :~)
